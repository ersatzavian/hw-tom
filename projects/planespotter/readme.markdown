# Planespotter Open ADS-B Receiver
Planespotter is a side project by [Tom Byrne](https://github.com/ersatzavian). The goal is a small, low-cost ADS-B receiver that includes the RF front end and decoder stages. RF comes in, decoded traffic messages come out over USB. 

## Summary
The RF front-end on planespotter is heavily based upon the [miniadsb](http://miniadsb.web99.de/homepage/index.php?way=1&site=READOUT&DERNAME=miniADSB%20Tutorial&dm=miniadsb&USER=miniadsb&goto=1&XURL=web99.de&WB=&EXTRAX=X&PIDX=63606) receiver by jetvision. I'm grateful to them for being willing to sell me just one or two SAW filters. They're the best place to find the TA1090EC and TA0232A required by this design unless you're buying thousands of them. 

Planespotter uses an STM32F030K6 MCU as the decoder. The STM32 family of microprocessors includes a very useful embedded bootloader, so the device can be reprogrammed over UART, elminating the need for an expensive in-system programmer. This design also includes an FT230X USB-to-Serial bridge, so the MCU can be reprogrammed right from a PC with just a binary image file.

## Programming
To write a new image to the onboard flash on the STM32F030K6:

1. You may need to install [FTDI's Virtual Com Port Driver](http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm) if you're not on OS X. 
2. Download and install Python, required for [stm32loader](https://github.com/jsnyder/stm32loader).
3. Plug planespotter into your PC over USB. If you're using a VM, make sure to share the FTDI USB-to-Serial Device with the VM from the host machine. 
4. Find the device name for the usb-serial adapter on your planespotter:

    ```
    $ ls /dev/tty.usbserial*
    /dev/tty.usbserial-DB00KYMI
    ```
5. Place the STM32 in Device Firmware Upgrade (DFU) Mode by holding S50 (BOOT0), tapping S20 (RESET_L), and releasing S50.
6. Make sure planespotter and the binary you are flashing are in the same directory (they are, if you're using a binary provided at planespotter/software/).
7. Use stm32loader to load the binary onto Planespotter:

    ```
    $ ./stm32loader.py -e -w -v -p /dev/tty.usbserial-DB00KYMI -b 57600 <image_name>
    Bootloader version 31
    Chip id: 0x444 (Unknown)
    Extended erase (0x44), this can take ten seconds or more
    Writing: 100% Time: 0:00:13 |#################################################|
    Reading: 100%, Time: 0:00:07 |################################################|
    Verification OK
    ```
8. When programming has finished, tap the Reset button (S20). 

## Software
Software for this project will be posted here as it is developed. This project doesn't have working ADS-B detector software yet as I'm still learning how to use the peripherals I need. Buttons, LEDS, Interrupts, and UART functionality are all up and running. 

I will likely post multiple project directories for software versions until there is one working build of Planespotter software; right now there's just the "helloworld" project directory. To pick up where I'm at, start with the Keil ÂµVision project at `planespotter-helloworld/MDK-ARM/planespotter-helloworld.uvprojx`. 

To get a hex file to program onto the board, make sure "Create HEX File" is checked in the Target Options, under the "Output" tab. Name the executable however you'd like under "Name of Executable" while you're there. A Hex file will be deposited at (for example) `planespotter-helloworld/MDK-ARM/planespotter-helloworld Configuration/[name of executable].hex`

## Design Files
For the actual files used to produce fabricated boards, see the releases folder. Every release will include a schematic PDF, Bill of Materials (BOM), and set of Gerber files used to fab the PCB. 

## ECOs
### Rev 1.0
| Problem | Fix | Notes |
| ------- | --- | ----- |
| Allow onboard FTDI to toggle BOOT0 for easier target programming | | |
| Add labels to S20 and S50, J50 | | |
